# Summary of the Presentation:
## Current Situation:
**Vision Zero SF's Goal**: Aimed to achieve zero traffic deaths by 2024.<br>
**Challenges**: No reduction in traffic fatalities has been observed, despite having excellent data and in-depth analysis. Bureaucratic red tape, legislative hurdles, and resource constraints were significant obstacles.<br>
## Data Analysis:
**High-Risk Areas**: The data analysis identified streets like Mission Street, Market Street, and Van Ness Avenue as most incident-prone.<br>
**Accident Types**: A significant proportion of accidents involved pedestrians, particularly on crosswalks. One out of four accidents occurred during lane changes or turns.<br>
**Severity Analysis**: The model distinguished between severe (fatal or medical emergencies) and less severe injuries, aiming to reduce the risk of severe injuries through targeted interventions.<br>
## Proposed Solutions:
**Infrastructure Modifications**: 3D painted crosswalks to create the illusion of raised crosswalks, which could help in reducing pedestrian accidents.<br>
**Traffic Regulation Change**s: Implementing a 'No Right Turns on Red' policy in high-risk areas to decrease the chances of pedestrian incidents.<br>
**Public Awareness Campaigns**: Increase awareness about safe lane changing and the importance of checking blind spots.<br>
**Technological Enhancements**: Introduce mirror calibration boards at strategic locations to help drivers adjust their mirrors correctly before merging or making turns.<br>
## Impact and Benefits:
**Economic Benefits**: Safer streets could lead to higher foot traffic and potentially increase sales for local businesses.<br>
**Community Engagement**: The proposed measures are cost-effective and can be rapidly implemented, focusing on scalability and practicality.<br>
## Future Directions:
**Evaluation and Scaling**: The effectiveness of the solutions would be monitored, and successful strategies would be expanded to other parts of the city.<br>
**Data-Driven Adjustments**: Continuously update and adjust strategies based on new data and effectiveness assessments.<br>
